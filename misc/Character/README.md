# Character

## Description

Security through Induced Boredom is a personal favorite approach of mine. Not as exciting as something like The Fray, but I love making it as tedious as possible to see my secrets, so you can only get one character at a time!

## Solution

In this challenge, a script is running on the server. Use `nc` to interact with it. The server will ask you to provide an index number, and it will print the string value of the flag at that index.

Let's automate this task using a simple Python script.
